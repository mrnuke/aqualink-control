aqualink-control development tools
==================================

The `tools` directory contains a seris of scripts and tools that are intended
for development, but are not part of the final aqualink-control program.

aquaproto.py
------------

`aquaproto` is a basic implementation of the aqualink protocol encoding and
transmission. It is also a standalone tool that monitors an RS-485 bus for
aqualink pakets.
